# UETestbed

Project synopsis-

This is a collaborative project made by a couple of friends to show off some of the skills we've picked up with unreal engine over the years.

It is a collection of random game systems we've all either wanted to develop over the courses of our careers, or expand over, and this repository is an extension of that desire. We each have our own testbed levels and/or games within this repository that shows off who we are as developers.

    I've created this repo and am managing it, making sure everything is in good shape. I will also be looking after the module structure.
    
    I'm primarily interested in Gameplay and Tools programming. Within this project, I mainly intend to have a level which shows off different character mechanics. I will also be writing editor customisations by creating new asset pipelines and by customising the details panel.
